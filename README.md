Hawkes Binomial Topic Model


Hawkes Binomial Topic Model (HBTM) is a Hawkes process where marks are represented 
as bags of words following a Binomial distribution. When viewed as a branching process, 
the daughter event bag of words is generated by randomly turning on/off parent words through 
independent Bernoulli random variables.
